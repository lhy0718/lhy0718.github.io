**Summary:** I have completed the translation of Langgraph's documentation using the [code documentation auto-translation agent](https://lhy0718.github.io/agents/Langgraph-Docs-translator/) that I developed.

- Repository: [https://github.com/lhy0718/langgraph](https://github.com/lhy0718/langgraph)  
- The translation was performed using the GPT-4o-mini model, with a total API cost of USD 0.48, including unnecessary requests.  
- ~~Issue: Translated `.ipynb` files were not rendering properly on GitHub, and I was working on a fix.~~ â†’ Resolved by applying `"nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 5` to the `.ipynb` files.
